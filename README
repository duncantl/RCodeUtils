This is currently a small collection of tools for use in interactive sessions
that facilitate debugging, timing and checking code.

```r
idebug(call(x, y, z))
```
temporarily sets debug for call and unsets this after the call is over.
This simplifies 
```r
debug(call)
call(z, y, z)
undebug(call)
```

tmSource() is a simple replacement for source() that returns
the evaluation time (system.time()) for each expression in the 
file being source.

checkPkgCode() examines code in an installed R package to 
verify that all symbols that are referenced actually exist
and similarly, all classes that are defined have a defined parent/base class.
